# Monitor-CryptoBox
![Image of setup](https://github.com/TechCryptoLife/Monitor-CryptoBox/blob/main/pictures/IMG_0565.HEIC)
Monitor temperature, barometric pressure and altitude using BMP280

## Why did I make this?
I wanted to monitor the outside crypto box that I house some of my crypto miners that mostly use antenne's and radio frequencies to earn different cryptocurrencies.
